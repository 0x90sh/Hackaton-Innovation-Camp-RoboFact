## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js:** (version 16 or higher recommended) - [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **npm** (Node Package Manager): Typically comes with Node.js
*   **A web browser:** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

2.  **Install project dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Download model from https://starux.ch/default_arm.glb -> automation_designer/dist/default_arm.glb

    This command will install all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file.

## Build Instructions

Building the project prepares it for deployment by optimizing the code and assets.

1.  **Run the build command:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This command executes the Webpack build process, configured in `webpack.config.js`. It will generate optimized files (JavaScript bundles, assets) within the `dist` directory.

    *   `webpack --mode production`: This command tells Webpack to build the project in **production** mode, enabling optimizations like minification and tree shaking for improved performance.

## Serve Instructions (Development)

For local development, use the Webpack Dev Server to automatically rebuild and serve the project as you make changes.

1.  **Run the serve command:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This command starts the Webpack Dev Server, which will:

    *   Watch your source files for changes.
    *   Automatically rebuild the project when you save files.
    *   Serve the built files from memory, providing fast updates.
    *   Open your web browser to the specified port (typically `http://localhost:8080`, but check your `webpack.config.js`).

    *  `webpack serve --mode development`:  This command tells Webpack to serve the project in **development** mode.

## Folder Structure

```bash
project-root/
├── dist/ # Output directory for built files (generated by npm run build)
├── src/ # Source code directory
│ ├── index.js # Main entry point of your application
│ └── ... # Other source files, assets, etc.
├── package.json # Project metadata and dependencies
├── package-lock.json # Records the exact versions of dependencies
├── webpack.config.js # Webpack configuration file
└── README.md # This file
```
## Dependencies

The project uses the following dependencies (listed in `package.json`):

### DevDependencies (for development)

*   `three`: Core Three.js library
*   `webpack`: Module bundler
*   `webpack-cli`: Command line interface for Webpack
*   `webpack-dev-server`: Development server for Webpack

### Dependencies (required at runtime)

*   `three-gltf-loader`: GLTF model loader
*   `three-orbitcontrols`: Orbit camera controls
*   `three-transform-controls`: Transform controls for object manipulation
*   `three-transformcontrols`: Another package for transform controls (may need to review which one is needed)
